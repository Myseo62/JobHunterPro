                Founded in 2023 by a team of HR professionals and technology experts, Career-Bazaar was born from a simple observation: 
                the job search process was broken for both job seekers and employers.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Job seekers were spending countless hours applying to positions that weren't the right fit, while employers 
                struggled to find qualified candidates among thousands of applications. We knew there had to be a better way.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Our founders combined their expertise in human resources, technology, and user experience design to create 
                a platform that truly serves both sides of the hiring equation. Today, Career-Bazaar helps thousands of 
                professionals find meaningful work while enabling companies to discover exceptional talent.
